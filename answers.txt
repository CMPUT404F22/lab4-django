Question 1: What is the link to your github repository for this lab?
https://github.com/CMPUT404F22/lab4-django

Question 2: After starting a brand new Django application and running the runserver command, 
what does the browser show you?
It shows that the Django installation has successfully worked.


Question 3: After creating the first view within polls, 
what does the browser show you when navigating to / and to /polls respectively?
Answer: When navigating to /, we see a 'Page not found (404)' message. When navigating to /polls,
we see a page with the text 'Hello, world. You're at the polls index.'.


Question 4: What is a Django migration and why do we need them?
Answer: According to Django documentation, Django migrations are a history of database changes that Django can roll through to update
the database schema. Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time, as you develop your project, 
without the need to delete your database or tables and make new ones - it specializes in upgrading your database live, 
without losing data.


Question 5: What do you see after you log into the Django adminstration site? 
From a high level, how do you get custom models to appear in the Django admin page?
Answer: After logging into the Django adminstration site, we see a few types of editable content: groups
and users. They are provided by the authentication framework shipped by Django.
We can get custom models to appear in the Django admin page by registering the model from the admin.py file
of a Django app.


Question 6: What do you see when you go to /polls/38/ in your browser? What about /polls/38/results and /polls/38/vote? 
What happens when you donâ€™t put a number, and instead use a string? How would you modify the urls.py file to allow arbitrary alphabetic characters?
Answer: When we go to /polls/38/, the following text is seen - "You're looking at question 38."
When we go to /polls/38/results, "You're looking at the results of question 38."
When we go to /polls/38/vote, "You're voting on question 38."
When we put a string instead of a number, we get a "Page Not Found (404)" message.

To allow arbitrary alphabetic characters, we can define our own path converter with the regex [a-zA-Z]+,
register the converter in urls.py module of the app and use it. Reference: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/urls/#path-converters


Question 7: Why is it a bad idea to hardcode urls into the templates?
Answer: Hardcoding urls into the templates creates tight coupling. So it becomes challenging to change URLs on projects
with lots of templates.

Question 8: What are the benefits of using Django's generic views over writing views 'the hard way'? 
When should you use a generic view and when shouldn't you use a generic view?
